# SyncVR-Minigame
INFO:
This is a game for children to play during an operation to stay distracted from the pain.

Therefore I've chosen to make a game that restarts almost immediately, so the kid can play non-stop and doesn't have to restart or wait for long.

I've also kept the aesthetics of the game quite playful and child-like. The color palette I've used is from www.colorhunt.co. It's a child-friendly color palette. The background music is a child-friendly farm music loop that really fits the rest of the aesthetics. The language used by the farmer is of course also super child friendly.

At the start of the game, you see the menu screen where a farmer asks you to help him feed his animals. When you press play the game starts and you see how many animals you have to feed.

I've chosen this story because it's also quite child-friendly: you don't shoot anything or kill enemies or something child-unfriendly. You're just helping a farmer feed his animals, which in my opinion is super child-friendly.

There's an increasing difficulty which means that the animals spawn faster every 10 seconds. This gives the game an extra layer and also makes it more difficult to complete the game. Of course, we want the child to take some time before completing the game so the doctors have enough time to complete their operation.

CONTROLS:
Use A-D keys or left and right arrows to move

Use Spacebar to throw food

Press Escape while playing to pause the game

OBJECTIVE:
Help the farmer feed all of the hungry animals by throwing bananas at them. After feeding 100 animals the farmer will thank you and you can either quit the game or start again
